# AI-Generated vs Human-Generated Text Classification System 

This is an Machine Learning/NLP project that detects whether a given text sample is authored by a human or generated by an AI model

## Data description:
- **id**: ID of column
- **label**: If column is ai or human (Target variable) 
- **topic**: Topic of the column
- **length_chars**: Number of characters in the text
- **length_words**: Total number of words in the text
- **quality_score**: Quality score of text
- **sentiment**: Sentiment score of the text
- **source_detail**: Source of the text
- **timestamp**: Timestamp of the text
- **plagiarism_score**: Plagiarism score of the text
- **notes**

## Objective:
Detect whether a given text sample is authored by a human or generated by an AI model.

## Use Cases:
- Identifying AI-generated academic submissions.
- Detecting fake product reviews written by bots/AI agents in E-commerce.
- Detecting and identifying AI-generated social media content in media and advertising. 

## Analysis done on text:
- Data Cleaning & Lemmatization
- Most common words per class
- Wordclouds for Human vs AI
- N-Gram Analysis
- Complexity measures (Flesh score & lexical diversity)
- Bag of words
- TF-IDF
- Sentence Embeddings
- LLM-based embeddings
- SHAP & LIME Explainability
